The meeting began with a welcome and a brief agenda outline, covering Q1 performance, upcoming goals, and budget issues. The speaker praised the team for the successful product launch, noting a slight increase in engagement and flagged marketing expenditures for further discussion. A reminder was given that expense reports are due Friday, with a humorous note on not booking first-class flights, indirectly aimed at Greg. The focus then shifted to discussing financial figures.
